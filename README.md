# Coal-Expanded (Game mod for Factorio)
> Thank you for almost 2,000 downloads!

This mod attempts to make coal less of a storage hog while making it more useful as a fuel source by adding new recipes to create new types of coal by condensing it -- making it take up less storage space while also providing more fuel per unit (if toggled ON).

Currently it adds 5 new fuels (aside from diamonds, they are real variations of coal -- in ascending order according to their purity and energy density): 
1. Lignite
2. Sub-Bituminous Coal
3. Bituminous Coal
4. Anthracite
5. Diamond

Which are crafted by:

- 10 coal --> 1 Lignite (10x one piece of coal)
- 10 Lignite --> 1 Sub-Bituminous Coal (100x one piece of coal)
- 10 Sub-Bituminous Coal --> 1 Bituminous Coal (1_000x one piece of coal)
- 10 Bituminous Coal --> 1 Anthracite (10_000x one piece of coal)
- 10 Anthracite --> 1 Diamond (100_000x one piece of coal)

---

## The specific fuel totals are:

- 1 coal = 4 MJ
- 1 Lignite = 40 MJ
- 1 Sub-Bituminous Coal = 400 MJ
- 1 Bituminous Coal = 4_000 MJ (4 GJ)
- 1 Anthracite = 40_000 MJ (40 GJ)
- 1 Diamond = 400_000 MJ (400 GJ)

## Mod Settings (available in main start-up menu)
> Each of these settings is DEFAULT FALSE, so if a player thinks they are cheating or does not like them....... don't go and turn them on.
1. Coal density energy bonus
  - Each compressed coal type receives a bonus amount of energy in addition to retaining an equivalent amount of energy to the number of compressed pieces of coal.
  - Example:  12 Bituminous Coal == 12_000 coal + (12 * Bituminous Coal energy bonus [IF TOGGLED ON])
2. Coal density speed bonus
  - Vehicles powered by dense coal receives acceleration and maximum speed bonuses, with higher bonuses given for more-dense coal variants.
3. Coal items stack size increase
  - Changes coal and all dense coal variants to have a maximum stack-size of 1_000.
  - This is geared more toward players not using other mods that increase stack size (me)

## Future Plans:

- Coal variant decompression
- Coal liquefaction (?)
- Add to tech tree so that compression must be unlocked
- Add a compressor building for the coal compresion
