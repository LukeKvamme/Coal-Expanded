# Coal-Expanded 
(Game mod for Factorio)

This mod attempts to make coal less of a storage hog while making it more useful as a fuel source by adding new recipes to create new types of coal by condensing it -- making it take up less space while also providing more fuel per unit.

Currently it adds 5 new fuels (aside from diamonds, they are real variations of coal -- in ascending order according to their purity and energy density):
      1. Lignite
      2. Sub-Bituminous Coal
      3. Bituminous Coal
      4. Anthracite
      5. Diamond

Which are crafted by:
	10 coal			             --> 1 Lignite             (10x one piece of coal)
	10 Lignite 		           --> 1 Sub-Bituminous Coal (100x one piece of coal)
	10 Sub-Bituminous Coal   --> 1 Bituminous Coal     (1_000x one piece of coal)
	10 Bituminous Coal 	     --> 1 Anthracite          (10_000x one piece of coal)
  10 Anthracite		         --> 1 Diamond             (100_000x one piece of coal)

  The specific fuel totals are:
  1 coal = 4 MJ
  1 Lignite = 40 MJ
  1 Sub-Bituminous Coal = 400 MJ
  1 Bituminous Coal = 4_000 MJ (4 GJ)
  1 Anthracite = 40_000 MJ (40 GJ)
  1 Diamond = 400_000 MJ (400 GJ)

Future Plans:
-Add to tech tree so that compression must be unlocked
